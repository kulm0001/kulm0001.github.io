            <p>My name is Ayana. I am 17 years old. I am an international student
                from Kazakhstan. I decided to choose Interactive Media Design program
            because I have been working in this area since childhood. I am still not sure 
        about my plans after getting a diploma. I may go to the university for a bechelor's degree
    or may just find myself a good job.</p>
            <p>I am interested in videography, photoshop, photography and video editing. I used to have
                a YouTube channel when I was 9 years old and that is why I know some material in this industry.
                I really like playing video games, this is also one of the reasons of me choosing <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">
                    IMD
                </abbr> program
                because after getting a base of knowledge, I may learn game programming. My favorite games
                are The Sims 4 and GTA 5 Online.
